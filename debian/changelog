  * Post release version bump
  * Refresh translations from zanata
  * tests: display info about what failed in media/tree URI tests.
    Make it possible to debug failures by displaying the URL,
    curl error code/message and http code.

  * tests: ignore transient failures in media/tree URI tests.
    Some times the media/tree URI tests will fail with a timeout trying
    to connect to the server. Treat this as non-fatal since it will
    usually just indicate a transient network or server failure.

  * Refresh translations from zanata
  * Update NEWS for 1.3.0 release
  * Post release version bump to 1.4.0
  * tests: add one test case per OS tested.
    The image, media & tree URIs test suites just register one test case for
    all the work they do. As a result when they run they just sit there
    printing no progress information for a long time.
    This changes then to register one test case per OS in the database. As a
    result we get progress information. An added benefit is that it is
    possible to now run tests for individual OS by passing the -p argument.
      eg  test-mediauris -p /mediauris/uris/rhel3.9

  * os: Support inherited resources.
    As resources are pretty much the same for new releases of a same OS,
    having them explicitly set is a source of copy-and-paste error and
    redundant information in our db.
    The approach taken to properly support inheritance of OSes is a
    explicitly set attribute to the resources indicating that they should be
    inherited.
    Here's an example of how the XML will look like:
    foo:
      <resources arch="all">
        <minimum>
          <n_cpus>1</n_cpus>
          <storage>1</storage>
        </minimum>
      </resources>
    bar (which derives-from/clones foo):
      <resources arch="all" inherit="true">
        <minimum>
          <n_cpus>3</n_cpus>
          <ram>3</ram>
        </minimum>
      </resources>
    When querying for bar's minimum resources, we'll get:
    n_cpus: 3
    cpu: -1 (not set, by any of the OSes)
    ram: 3
    storage: 1

    It's important to mention that although the methods are taking GFlags,

    mentioned in the documentation.
    Also, mind that the usage of osinfo_entity_set_param() to store the

  * media: Check whether PPC ISOs are bootable.
    PPC ISOs do not have the "El Torito" extension that describes whether
    the media is bootable or not. However, they have a "bootinfo.txt" file
    placed under "ppc" directory in order to specify the media is bootable.
    So, let's add a few more checks looking for "/ppc/bootinfo.txt" in case
    the El Torito header is not found.
    The whole implementation has been based on the following sources:
    - The ISO 9660 (ECMA-119) specification:
      http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-119.pdf
    - The ISO 9660 osdev wiki page:
      https://wiki.osdev.org/ISO_9660
    - IBM's developer article:
      https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-detecting-bootable-ibm-power-server-iso-images/index.html
    And what the implementation does is:
    - Access the *root* directory record, which has a fixed size of 33 bytes
      and is located at the bytes offset 156 of the PVD;
    - Load the *root* directory record extent content into the memory and:
      - Search for the the dir/file we're looking at;
      - In the dir is present, we load its directory record extent content
        into the memory and search for the next dir/file;
        - In case the file is present, we return that the media is bootable;
        - Otherwise, we return the media is non bootable;
    Mind, though, that this code is *not* generic enough to be adapted in
    case we want to search for a different dir/file and the reason for that
    is related to some ISOs using a TRANS.TBL table that translates the
    given name of a file to the shown name of the same file.
    If, for some reason, we ever want to take the path of having this code
    more generic we'd have to:
    - For each directory acessed, search for TRANS.TBL;
      - In case it's present, load its content into a hash table and, for
        each dir/file, check the name of the file we're looking for with the
        shown name (only present in the TRANS.TBL;
      - Otherwise, just follow the very same code we currently have;
    The decision for not implementing this TRANS.TBL changes is, mainly,
    because it'd make the code circa twice slower than it currently is
    (as we'd have to search for the TRANS.TBL as the first thing ...)
    without any specific gain for the needs we have right now. In case
    there's the need, in the future, it could be implemented in the way
    described here.
